| P1        | 15     | 15     | 100%  | ✅ PASS  |
| P2        | 13     | 13     | 100%  | ✅ PASS  |
| P3        | 0     | 0     | 100%  | ✅ PASS  |
| **Total** | **38**    | **38**    | **100%** | **✅ PASS** |

## PHASE 2: QUALITY GATE DECISION

### Gate Criteria Evaluation

#### P0 Criteria (Must ALL Pass)

| Criterion             | Threshold | Actual                    | Status   |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------------------------- | -------- |
| P0 Coverage           | 100%      | 100%            | ✅ PASS  |
| Critical Gaps         | 0         | 0           | ✅ PASS  |

**P0 Evaluation:** ✅ ALL PASS

---

#### P1 Criteria (Required for PASS)

| Criterion              | Threshold  | Actual               | Status   |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | -------- |
| P1 Coverage            | ≥90%       | 100%       | ✅ PASS  |
| High Priority Gaps     | 0          | 0          | ✅ PASS  |
| Overall Coverage       | ≥90%       | 100%  | ✅ PASS  |

**P1 Evaluation:** ✅ ALL PASS

### Decision Summary

| Decision Element | Value |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| **Gate Decision** | **PASS** |
| **P0 Coverage** | 100% (Required: 100%) |
| **Overall Coverage** | 100% (Target: 90%) |
| **Critical Gaps** | 0 |
| **High Gaps** | 0 |

---

### Rationale

P0 coverage is 100% and overall coverage is 100% (target: 90%). All requirements fully covered.

---

## Recommendations

1. **LOW**: Run /bmad:tea:test-review to assess test quality

---

## Next Actions


### For PASS Decision ✅

1. **Proceed to deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Validate with smoke tests
   - Monitor key metrics for 24-48 hours
   - Deploy to production with standard monitoring

2. **Post-Deployment Monitoring**
   - Monitor P0 test execution
   - Track error rates
   - Verify audit logging

3. **Success Criteria**
   - All P0 tests pass in production
   - No critical errors in logs
